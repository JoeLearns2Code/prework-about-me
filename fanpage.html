<h2>About the Band:</h2>
<p>Amon Amarth is a Swedish melodic death metal band devoted to all things Viking.  The band formed in 1992, and released its first full-length album, <i>Once Sent from the Golden Hall</i> in 1998.
While the band has had a number of line up changes, core founder Olavi Mikkonen and vocalist Johan Hegg remain in the band to this day.
<p>
The musical style is reminiscent of the Gothenburg metal sound, featuring melodic riffs accompanied by fast-paced percussion and Hegg's signature growling vocals.  
At times the tone is somber, but more often bombastic and thrilling, with nearly every track the band has ever written dedicated to the subject matter of Norse mythology and history.
