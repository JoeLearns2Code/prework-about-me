      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am 39 years old and looking to start a new career.  Previously I spent 8 years managing a small team dedicated to adding marketing data to a home improvement website.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Washington state.  I have traveled to a number of different places both within the US and to several other countries.  While I am certainly fond of some of these places, I still think western Washington is one of the most beautiful places in the world.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Reading, gaming, watching films, taking long walks.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job where I can fully utilize my intellect.  I have some marketing and leadership skills, and I would love to one day be in a position where I can combine what I've learned in the past with the new skills that I will hopefully acquire through this program.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Kirkland, WA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I got a small taste of coding during my last job.  I worked alongside developers and was always curious about the work they did.  Most of all, I want to develop a valuable and marketable set of skills that I can utilize both in a career and also enjoy learning more about in my personal time.</p>
